# Ardaans ASM

**DISCLAIMER: This project is still in development. All you'll see might change in the future.**

Ardaans is a small assembly language, that I'm making to learn more on language design, and also for fun.

Ardaans is still in Beta (version 0.1).

[Learn more](Doc.md).

# Run via executable
To run directly via the executable file `ardaans`. Simply run this command in your terminal:
```
$ ./ardaans file
```
Where `file` is the file containing the code to run.

# Run from sources
To compile and run from sources, you must have .NET Core 3 installed on your PC.

First, download the sources. Then, go in `Ardaans` directory, you'll find a file `Ardaans.csproj`. You are in the good directory.

Now, run:
```
$ dotnet run file
```
Where `file` is the file containing the code to run.
